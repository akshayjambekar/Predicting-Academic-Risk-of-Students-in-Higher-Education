Predicting Academic Risk of Students in Higher Education


• Description: Developed a model to predict the academic risk of students in higher 
education, focusing on classifying students into categories: Graduate, Enrolled, and 
Dropout.
• Key Techniques: Used HistGradientBoostingClassifier for classification and 
SMOTE for data augmentation to handle imbalanced data.
• Results: Achieved an accuracy of 86.2% in predicting student academic risk. The 
model demonstrated high precision and recall across multiple categories, with a macro 
average f1-score of 0.86.
• Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, SMOTE.
